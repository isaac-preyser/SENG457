    "The goal of this Term Portfolio Project (TPP) is to document your learning journey into the realm of Quantum Computing by developing a Jupyter Notebook Portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "First and foremost, this document is for you to reflect regularly on your learning journey. Secondly, it is intended for your instructors and teaching assistants to gauge your progress in understanding the topics being discussed in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Portfolio Term Project should be developed incrementally &mdash; with weekly contributions. The TPP consists of two parts. The first part should be approximately 5-7 pages (i.e., printing Jupyter Notebook as PDF pages).  The second part must include the first part at the beginning of the document -- that is, simply extend the Part 1 Jupyter Notebook to develop the second part. Thus, the final Jupyter Notebook that includes both parts should be approximately 18-20 pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Part 1, you are to document the following aspects of your Quantum computing journey, and also your experience learning the functionality and use of Jupyter Notebooks. Here are some questions you can answer for Part 1 of your TPP.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How did you get up to speed in basic linear algebra (e.g., Euler formula, complex plane,  linear transformations or operators, eigenvectors and eigenvalues), including which resources you consulted in this process?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. How did you get started in documenting linear algebra formulas (e.g., Euler formula or matrices) using LaTeX Markdown in Jupyter Notebooks?  Develop your own cheat sheet of the quantum computing formulas and Dirac notation to ease assignment typesetting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. How did you get started running your first quantum circuits using IBM Qiskit and Xanadu Pennylane Jupyter Notebook platforms?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. How would you motivate other students to join the journey into quantum computing given the motivational materials presented in class and found in the references? Your answers to this question will likely evolve during this course. Revisit regularly this quesion.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Which algorithm is your favourite quantum algorithm so far?\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What was the most challenging part in understanding Grover's algorithm?\n",
    "7. (Required) What are your personal insights, aha moments, and epiphanies you experienced in the first part of this course?\n",
    "8. (Required) How did you experience Generative AI as a learning tool for this course?\n",
    "Record your Generative AI prompts and contexts for Basic Quantum Terms, Complex Linear Algebra, Quantum Algorithms, Python, Qiskit, and PennyLane inquiries for easy recall. Use the same line item or project in your genAI engine (e.g., ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Perplexity, or others) to build up the \"quantum context\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Citations and references. The contents of your notebook portfolio project must be your own work. If you reference the work of others (including information found on the web or using genAI tools), include full citations in a bibliography at the end of your document."
