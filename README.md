# SENG 457

This repository contains my notes, experiments, labs and other thoughts that together document my learning journey in SENG457: Quantum Algorithms and Software Engineering. 

This is repository is spiritual successor to my previous workbook collection from [PHYS223](github.com/isaac-preyser/PHYS223).
