# SENG 457: Quantum Algorithms and Software Engineering

This repository contains my notes, experiments, labs and other thoughts that together document my learning journey in SENG457: Quantum Algorithms and Software Engineering. 

This repository is a spiritual successor to my previous workbook collection from [PHYS223](https://github.com/isaac-preyser/PHYS223), however this time around I aim to greatly increase the amount of commentary surrounding the notes to be more useful in later courses and work engagements.

Find some details from the course syllabus below: 

## Course Overview

This course focuses on the fundamentals of quantum computation, quantum algorithms, quantum software engineering, and hybrid quantum-classical problem solving. The course addresses the challenges of practical hybrid (quantum-classical) development including algorithm design, data management, problem decomposition, variational circuit design, software infrastructure, tool integration, and debugging.

The most promising hybrid algorithms and architectures provide avenues for developers to scale quantum applications gradually. We'll work with real-world quantum development kits (QDK) including IBM Qiskit and Xanadu Pennylane to implement quantum algorithms on both simulators and real quantum computers.
